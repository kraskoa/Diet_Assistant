# Project PIPR 2023Z

## Diet assistant

This is the repository for my CLI application that lets the user create their own custom diet based on a few input parameters. It uses data from the Edamam Recipe Search API. To run the app yourself, _you need to create a free account_ with Edamam and your own Recipe Search API application. Then you'll be asked to input your app's credentials into the program.

## Requirements

For the program to run properly just install of all the dependencies from [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) (don't worry, there's just one) and please use Python 3.7 or newer.

## Documentation

Please click [here](documentation.md) to access the full documentation of the project.
To run the app, just enter
```
make
```
into terminal when you're in the directory which you've cloned the project into.
