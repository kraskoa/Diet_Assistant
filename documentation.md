The problems I've encountered:

- Inconsistently named dishTypes in the API (for example recipe for Persimmon tea is assigned a "Main course" dishType)
- The proposed portions are probably too small, resulting in very low calories per portion for most meals
- Free API plan limitations may cause problems with running tests (limited frequency and number of API calls). It also causes some of them to be running for a very long time due to API reponse duration - up to around a minute.
